		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>First, complete a short flavor profile. We'll get a sense for what you like based on what you've bought before.</p>
		<p>Second, we send you 4oz. sample bags of coffee beans, based on your flavor profile.</p>
		<p>Then, opt in or out to order the beans we sent you. If you're not ready to buy, we'll send you more samples.</p>
